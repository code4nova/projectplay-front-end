Funded by the Virginia Foundation for Healthy Youth, FitArlington’s H-CAT \n           supports the Arlington area in efforts to reduce childhood obesity and promote health\n           by encouraging healthy living. The H-CAT Subcommittee on Early Education spearheaded\n           the effort to join Project Play by recruiting volunteers from the community to assess, \n           categorize, and evaluate more than 90 playgrounds in public parks and schoolyards \n           across Arlington. The Team is thrilled to add on to what A-COAN started, and improve\n           access to play spaces for families across the region.\n        </p>\n    </article>\n    <p id=\"copyright\">©2018&nbsp;Project Play Alexandria.&nbsp;All rights reserved.</p>\n  </section>\n </main>\n <footer>\n </footer>\n<script src=\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyCzKpIVbHrX5FU6qv-ke0LU1p4JlfNNfxU&callback=myMap\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n"},"hash":"620e29c1ae4f62305ff70d9567642d32","cacheData":{}}
