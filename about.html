          <p>Project Play is a joint venture of the Alexandria Childhood Obesity Action Network 
             (A-COAN) and the FitArlington Healthy Community Action Team (H-CAT) that seeks to 
             improve play opportunities in Northern Virginia by:
           </p>
          <ul>
              <li>promoting higher quality play spaces throughout the Alexandria and Arlington,</li>
              <li>advocating for fairer distribution of play spaces across Alexandria and Arlington,</li>
              <li>providing easy-to find information about play spaces, and</li>
              <li>generating interest in play and offering ideas for play</li>
          </ul>
          <p>An A-COAN task force created Project Play in 2009 in an effort to improve play 
             opportunities for children in the City of Alexandria, Virginia. Neighbors, early 
             childhood and healthy living activists, folks from the Parks and Recreation and
             Health Departments, and other City offices and organizations have joined together 
             in A-COAN to improve and enhance play spaces for kids in Alexandria.

        <h3>Alexandria Has a Play Policy</h3>
        <p>The Alexandria  City Council adopted a Play Policy thanks to the advocacy and 
           hard work of the Project Play team, and based in large part on the play space 
           assessment we commissioned. <a href="http://alexandriaplays.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Playspace-Policy.pdf" alt="Alexandria Play Policy" target="_blank">Read it here</a>. Now our City departments have official
           guidelines when they make important decisions about play spaces for kids all over
           Alexandria.

        <h3>Expanding Project Play</h3>
        <p>In 2015, A-COAN invited the FitArlington H-CAT to add Arlington’s playgrounds
           to Project Play, expanding play opportunities for both jurisdictions alike. 
           Like A-COAN, H-CAT consists of a mixture of community members and Arlington 
           County employees who are passionate about the health and well-being of Arlington’s 
           children. Funded by the Virginia Foundation for Healthy Youth, FitArlington’s H-CAT 
           supports the Arlington area in efforts to reduce childhood obesity and promote health
           by encouraging healthy living. The H-CAT Subcommittee on Early Education spearheaded
           the effort to join Project Play by recruiting volunteers from the community to assess, 
           categorize, and evaluate more than 90 playgrounds in public parks and schoolyards 
           across Arlington. The Team is thrilled to add on to what A-COAN started, and improve
           access to play spaces for families across the region.
